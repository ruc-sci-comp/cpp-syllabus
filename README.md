## Course Description

This course is a one-semester crash-course on the C++ programming language with applications in scientific computing. The primary goal of the course is to give the student an overview of C++; this will always be the priority. All coursework will encompass various topics across STEM. We will use C++ and computing techniques to produce and analyze data; we will also use other software, such as Python, to aid the analysis.

## University Policies on Disabilities

Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation:

https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campusâ€™s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this process, please complete the Registration form at https://webapps.rutgers.edu/student-ods/forms/registration.

## Expectations

First and foremost, anticipate frustration. The material may not come easily and so I expect everyone to work diligently and to be patient with it. I expect you to ask questions and ask for help, do not hesitate to ask anything! I am here to help; I will be more concerned if I do not get questions.
