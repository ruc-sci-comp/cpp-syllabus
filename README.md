## Course Description

This course is a one-semester crash-course on the C++ programming language with applications in scientific computing. The primary goal of the course is to give the student an overview of C++; this will always be the priority. However, we will always be applying the C++ to various topics across STEM to give a broad understanding of how C++ can be applied to mathematics and the sciences.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

While there are no prerequisites for the course, you should be very comfortable with algebra, logic, and problem solving. From a technical perspective, you should be familiar with the basics of Linux, Git, and what it means to write code.

### Grading Policy

The semester will feature the following grades:

* 10 quizzes: 15%
* 10 homework assignments: 25%
* 1 midterm examination: 30%
* 1 final project: 30%

#### Final Grades

Letter grades are assigned as follows:

* A = 89.5-100
* B+ = 84.5-89.49
* B = 79.5-84.49
* C+ = 74.5-79.49
* C = 69.5-74.49
* D = 59.5-69.49
* F = 0-59.49

#### Extra Credit

There will be a handful of opportunities for extra credit. Any point(s) awarded are applied directly to your final grade.

### Remote Instruction

Our course will be conducted 100% remotely. We will meeting regularly at the scheduled time for the course via Discord, where I will give a lecture and then assist in coding exercises. Assignments will be given each week and will be due the following week. Quizzes will be given each week.

### Course Outline

Our week-to-week is organized as the following; though is subject to change depending on class pace. Unless noted in class, there will be a quiz and an assignment due almost every class. Weeks 01, 02, 08, and 14 will not have an assignments assigned. Weeks 01, 08, 09,  and 14 will not have a quiz.

## University Policies on Academic Integrity

Principles of academic integrity require that every Rutgers University student:

* properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others
* properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work
* make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of unsanctioned materials or unsanctioned collaboration
* obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her * interpretation or conclusions
* treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress
* uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for which he or she is preparing.

Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to insure that:

* everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments
* all student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others
* the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered
* the reputation of the University for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced.

Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld.

Infractions are not taken lightly and will fully be pursued. For additional information, visit [http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/)

## University Policies on Disabilities

Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation:

[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines](https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines).

If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this process, please complete the Registration form at [https://webapps.rutgers.edu/student-ods/forms/registration](https://webapps.rutgers.edu/student-ods/forms/registration).
